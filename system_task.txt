# Internship Management System - Detailed Task Description

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive web-based internship management system designed to facilitate the coordination between supervisors, coordinators, and interns. The system enables geofencing-based time tracking, room management, scheduling, and progress monitoring for internship programs.

## System Architecture
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database, Storage)
- **Maps & Geofencing**: Leaflet.js for interactive maps and geofence visualization
- **Additional Libraries**: Font Awesome for icons, SweetAlert2 for notifications, Flowbite for UI components

## User Roles and Functionalities

### 1. Supervisor Role
**Authentication**: Email/password with verification
**Key Features**:
- Register/login with organization details
- Create rooms with unique join codes for interns
- Set geofences on interactive maps for each room
- View list of interns assigned to them
- Monitor interns' timed-in status in real-time
- Log out all interns or themselves
- Manage room-specific geofences and boundaries

### 2. Coordinator Role
**Authentication**: Email/password with verification
**Key Features**:
- Register/login with organization details
- Create rooms with unique join codes
- Add detailed schedules for rooms (start/end dates, working hours, allowed days)
- Manage interns within their rooms
- Edit individual intern schedules
- View intern progress and attendance
- Log out all interns or themselves
- Generate and manage coordinator codes for intern registration

### 3. Intern Role
**Authentication**: Email/password with verification
**Key Features**:
- Register with supervisor email and coordinator code
- Join rooms using join codes
- Connect to supervisor zones (geofenced areas)
- Time in/out with geofence validation
- View personal progress tracking (hours completed vs total)
- Access coordinator-assigned tasks
- View supervisor information and geofence details
- Navigate between dashboard, time tracking, tasks, and reports sections

## Core Features

### Geofencing System
- Interactive map interface using Leaflet.js
- GPS-based location validation for time-in/out
- Configurable geofence radius (default 100 meters)
- Real-time location checking with user permission
- Visual geofence display on maps

### Room Management
- Unique join codes for room access
- Room-based organization of interns and schedules
- Separate handling for supervisor rooms (geofenced) vs coordinator rooms (scheduled)

### Scheduling System
- Flexible schedule creation (hours per day or start/end times)
- Support for allowed working days
- Automatic calculation of internship end dates
- Daily time breakdowns with pagination
- Individual intern schedule overrides

### Time Tracking
- GPS-validated time-in/out within geofences
- Automatic calculation of hours worked
- Support for overtime/undertime detection
- Real-time status updates (inside/outside)
- Progress tracking with circular progress indicators

### Progress Monitoring
- Visual progress bars for internship completion
- Hours remaining calculations
- Daily time schedule viewing
- Coordinator task assignments
- Supervisor zone connectivity status

## Database Structure (Firestore Collections)

### Users Collections:
- `supervisors`: Supervisor profiles with email, name, organization, geofence data
- `coordinators`: Coordinator profiles with email, name, organization, unique codes
- `interns`: Intern profiles with email, name, school, supervisor/coordinator links

### Operational Collections:
- `rooms`: Room definitions with join codes, creator info, intern lists
- `geofences`: Geofence data with center coordinates, radius, room associations
- `schedules`: Room schedules with dates, times, allowed days, total hours
- `interns_inside`: Real-time intern status, location, hours tracking
- `intern_reports`: Daily attendance and time records
- `intern_data`: Intern-specific data including schedules and geofences
- `tasks`: Coordinator-assigned tasks for interns

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
- Firebase Authentication with email verification
- Role-based access control
- Session management with confirmation modals
- Automatic logout on authentication state changes

### Map Integration
- Leaflet.js for map rendering
- OpenStreetMap tiles for base maps
- Dynamic marker placement for user locations
- Geofence circle overlays with customizable colors
- Map resizing and invalidation handling

### UI/UX Features
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-friendly sidebar navigation
- Modal-based forms and confirmations
- Loading spinners and progress indicators
- SweetAlert2 notifications for user feedback
- Kebab menus for additional actions

### Data Validation
- Client-side form validation
- Date range validation (end dates after start dates)
- Time format validation (HH:MM)
- Geofence radius and coordinate validation
- Email format and uniqueness checks

## Security Considerations
- Firebase security rules for data access control
- Email verification for all user accounts
- Role-based data filtering
- Secure API key management
- Location permission handling

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time notifications for time-in/out events
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Mobile app development
- Integration with external calendar systems
- Automated reminder systems
- Bulk operations for coordinators
- Advanced geofencing with multiple zones per room

## Development Notes
- All code is organized in separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Firebase configuration is centralized
- Error handling with try-catch blocks and user-friendly messages
- Code comments and documentation for maintainability
- Modular function structure for reusability

This system provides a complete solution for managing internship programs with modern web technologies, focusing on location-based time tracking and comprehensive progress monitoring.
