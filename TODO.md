# TODO List for Supervisor Room Time In/Out Fix

- [x] Identify issue: Interns can't time in/out in supervisor rooms because schedule fetching looks for schedule with user's uid as doc id, but supervisor rooms have shared schedules.
- [x] Update checkGeofence function to take the first schedule doc instead of finding by user uid for supervisor rooms.
- [x] Update timeOut function to take the first schedule doc instead of finding by user uid for supervisor rooms.
- [x] Update loadTotalHours function to handle supervisor rooms by taking the first schedule doc for shared schedules.
- [x] Verify that loadTotalHours and loadRoomProgress still filter by user uid for non-supervisor rooms.
- [x] Add debug logging to refreshBtn function for better troubleshooting of button states.
- [x] Test time in/out functionality in supervisor rooms.
- [x] Ensure no regressions in non-supervisor room functionalities.
